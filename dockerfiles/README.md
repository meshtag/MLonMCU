# ML on MCU — Docker + Jupyter Quick Start

This guide shows how to set up a clean Docker environment to run Jupyter (Notebook/Lab) for the **MLonMCU** exercises.

---

## 1) Clone the Repository

The structure should look like this:

```
MLonMCU/
├─ ex1
├─ ex2
├─ ...
└─ dockerfiles/
   ├─ Dockerfile
   ├─ docker-compose.yml
   ├─ requirements.txt
   ├─ start.sh
   └─ README.md
```

---

## 2) Install Docker (If you do not have it)

1. Download and install **Docker Desktop** for your OS:
   - Windows / macOS: install Docker Desktop and complete the setup.
   - Linux: install Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2 via your distro’s package manager.

2. Start Docker Desktop (or the Docker daemon on Linux).
   You should see an “Engine running” / “Docker is running” indicator in the app.

3. Verify in a terminal:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

---

## 3) Build the Image

From inside the `dockerfiles` directory:

```bash
cd MLonMCU/dockerfiles
docker compose build
```

This step downloads dependencies and may take a while the first time. It should finish without errors.

---

## 4) Run Jupyter

Start the container and launch Jupyter:

```bash
docker compose up
```

When it starts, the terminal will print a URL that looks like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Open **that** URL in your browser, or open:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

…and paste the displayed token if Jupyter asks for it.

---

## 5) Working with the Exercises

The entire `MLonMCU` repository is mounted directly into the container as `/workspace`. When you open Jupyter you will see all exercise folders (`ex1`, `ex2`, …) immediately.

---

## 6) Stopping and Restarting

- Stop (in the same terminal): press **Ctrl + C**.
- Cleanly shut down:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- Start again later:

  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```

---

## 7) Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Port already in use (8888):**
  Change the left side of the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `8890:8888`), then:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker compose up
  ```

- **Cannot see file updates:**
  Refresh the Jupyter page. If you changed files on the host while Jupyter was open, a refresh helps.
- **Permissions issues on Linux/macOS:**
  The compose file usually maps your host user ID automatically. If files appear as root-owned, rebuild with your UID or adjust the compose `user`/`args` settings as needed. For permission issues, please try `sudo`.
- **Rebuild after changing requirements:**

  ```bash
  docker compose build --no-cache
  docker compose up --force-recreate
  ```
